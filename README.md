### Description

This is a simple example of a tree search input. It is a component that allows you to search through a tree structure and select a node. The tree structure is defined by a list of objects, each of which has a `name` and `children` property. The `children` property is a list of objects with the same structure. The tree search input is a controlled component, so you need to pass in the `value` and `onChange` props.
